# useFocusMemory

A simple composable to manage focus transitions in popup components like modals, drawers, or sidebars.

It handles:

- Recording the element that had focus before the popup opened (`focusFrom`)
- Moving focus to the popup or container when opened (`focusTo`)
- Returning focus to the original element when closed (`returnFocus`)

---

## ‚ú® Features

- ‚úÖ `focusTo(targetEl)` moves focus into your popup
- ‚úÖ `returnFocus()` restores focus to what was focused before
- ‚úÖ Lightweight and reusable across all components
- ‚úÖ No side effects, no global listeners, no trapping

---

## üîß Usage

```js
import { ref } from 'vue'
import { useFocusMemory } from '@Composables/useFocusMemory'

const popupRef = ref(null)
const isOpen = ref(false)

const { focusFrom, focusTo, returnFocus } = useFocusMemory()

const openPopup = async () => {
  isOpen.value = true
  await focusTo(popupRef.value)
}

const closePopup = () => {
  isOpen.value = false
  returnFocus()
}
```

---

## üß† What `focusTo()` does

- Stores `document.activeElement` in `focusFrom`
- Focuses the first focusable child inside the container
- If none found, focuses the container itself

The container should have `tabindex="-1"` if it‚Äôs not naturally focusable.

---

## ‚úÖ Example HTML structure

```html
<button @click="openPopup">Open Sidebar</button>

<div v-if="isOpen" ref="popupRef" tabindex="-1">
  <button @click="closePopup">Close</button>
</div>
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- This composable is **not** a full focus trap
- It works well for modals, drawers, popovers ‚Äî anything popup-like
- Works best when paired with `@after-enter` for animated components
