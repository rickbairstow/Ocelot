# Ocelot UI

Ocelot UI (OUI), a UI framework built with Vue 3 and Tailwind CSS, is designed to be highly performant, optimised, and accessible. It strikes a balance by providing essential features without being overly opinionated, allowing for flexibility in your projects.

## Netlify Integration
OcelotUi's Storybook has been integrated into Netlify, you can access it at https://ocelotui.netlify.app. PRs will automatically be pushed to Netlify when they are merged to the main branch.
